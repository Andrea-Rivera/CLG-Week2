    <h2>Subscript and Superscript</h2>
    <p>
      The subscript text appears in a smaller font and the half character below
      the normal line. It is generally used to write chemical equations or
      chemical formulas such as H<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub>
    </p>
    <p>
      Superscript is generally used to write mathematical equations (like x
      <sup>2</sup> + y<sup>4</sup> = r<sup>6</sup>), footnotes, and many more.
    </p>
    <p>Descendant Selector :The descendant Selector selects all child elements of the selected parent element. In this
      example, the descendant selector selects all paragraphs descendant of the class "firstId"

    <h2>Strong, em</h2>
    <h3>Was <del>Bold</del> replaced by <ins>Strong</ins>?</h3>

    <p>
      HTML was never meant to be about styles.
      <strong> is semantic.</strong> Strong describes the text it surrounds
      (e.g., "this text should be stronger than the rest of the text you've
      displayed") as opposed to describing how the text it surrounds should be
      displayed (e.g., "this text should be bold"). Note that <b> BOLD </b> and
      <i> ITALIC </i> <span>have not been deprecated in HTML5.</span> Their new use is to
      semantically represent styles (or intended presentation), whereas
      <strong>STRONG </strong> and <em> EM </em> represent structure .

  <h1>From w3 Schools</h1>

  <h2>position: static;</h2>

  <p>An element with position: static; is not positioned in any special way; it is always positioned according to the
    normal flow of the page:</p>

  <div class="static">
    This div element has position: STATIC;
  </div>

  <h2>position: relative;</h2>

  <p>An element with position: relative; is positioned relative to its normal position:</p>

  <div class="relative">

    This div element has position: RELATIVE;
  </div>

  <h2>position: fixed;</h2>

  <p>An element with position: fixed; is positioned relative to the viewport, which means it always stays in the same
    place even if the page is scrolled:</p>

  <div class="fixed">
    This div element has position: FIXED; bottom:0px, right:0px
  </div>

  <h2>position: absolute;</h2>

  <p>An element with position: absolute; is positioned relative to the nearest positioned ancestor (instead of
    positioned relative to the viewport, like fixed):</p>

  <div class="absolute">
    This div element has position: ABSOLUTE;
  </div>
  </div>
